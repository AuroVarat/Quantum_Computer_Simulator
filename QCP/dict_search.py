"""Unsorted Dictionary Search using Quantum Grover

The file shows a possible application of Grover's Algorithm to a simple problem. 
This was inspired to possibly set up a Circuit that can play wordle.

Both Eager and Lazy methods are used to create separate circuits.

Problem : Search for a 5 letter word in a dictionary of 8192 words( actually close to 5K words but we added more empty words to simplify to the whole number of qubits).
